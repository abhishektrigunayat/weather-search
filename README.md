Implementation of a weather search application that provides features to search for weather details and forecast for any given zipcode or city name.  The backend is written in PHP that fetches the data from a Yahoo service, extracts the needed data and creates an XML. This XML is returned to a Java servlet that performs the validation and transforms it to JSON and returns it to the front end. The front end is implemented as a web page and an android application. The communication between front end and servlet is via AJAX calls. Also provided is the functionality to post the weather details on Facebook.
